My WordPress blog has been hacked, and for the time being I've decided to at least recover the content.

Luckily for me I had a recent backup and the DB looks good.

I could just re-install WP and import the backup, but I can't be bothered with maintaining WP again.

This is a tool to go from WP's 3.2.1 backup file to a set of static HTML pages following WP's permalink structure.

User at your own risk!
